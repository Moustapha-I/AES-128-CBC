# AES-128-CBC
Python code for AES encryption/decryption using 128 bits key and CBC block cipher mode

This repository includes two versions of my AES-128-CBC implementation. The first is a fully manual, from-scratch Python implementation that performs every AES operation internally, including key expansion, SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey, CBC mode, and PKCS#7 padding—without relying on any external libraries. The second version combines my custom AES engine with the Python cryptography library and provides a simple Tkinter UI that allows users to encrypt or decrypt input, compare results between my implementation and the official library, and verify correctness. This version also includes a built-in benchmarking module that measures execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption for both implementations. Together, these files demonstrate both the low-level mechanics of AES and practical verification and performance analysis.

Security Warning:
This implementation is not protected against side-channel attacks, and does not provide data integrity. It’s purely for educational purposes. For real-world use, always combine encryption with authentication (e.g., HMAC) and use a professionally audited crypto library.

DISCLAIMER: This project is intended strictly for educational and research purposes. While the implementation correctly follows the AES-128-CBC specification, it is not optimized, audited, or hardened for real-world security, and should not be used in production, nor relied on to protect sensitive or confidential data. Re-implementing cryptographic algorithms manually can introduce vulnerabilities, side-channel leaks, or unexpected weaknesses. For any practical or security-critical application, always use a well-maintained and professionally audited cryptographic library.
